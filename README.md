### 🌊 Cove Report 🌊
- 🌐 [Cove Report](https://cove-tracker.vercel.app/)
- 📝 Living by a cove in the stunning County Waterford, I enjoy nature's beauty daily. But, as a tech enthusiast, I wanted a tech spin on it! Thus was born *Cove Report* - a Next.js application that keeps me updated with real-time tide 🌊 and weather 🌤️ information right from the comfort of my home. With this project, I brought the outdoors, indoors! 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
